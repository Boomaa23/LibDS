# LibDS Rewrite
Another open soure FRC driver station.

## What Can I Use This For?
:heavy_check_mark: Controlling a RoboRIO with FRC software.

:x: Not for FRC events! FRC does not support this project.

## Why Rewrite
The goal of this repository is to improve upon the original LibDS created by Alex Spataru & Boomaa23.
I would have had fun using the original repository, but I acutally had issues with Qt and Cmake, so I
wanted to make an easier to implement project.
